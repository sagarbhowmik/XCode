     Another usage of virtual functions is when we can't/don't want to implement a method for the parent class. For example, that we want Student and Teacher to interit from Person so that we can implement a common method such as add_course(string s). Calling add_course on Person however, wouldn't make much sense since the implementation depends on whether the object is actually a Student or Teacher.
